## Log

- 11:00 Emerson (claude-code) — #19 report.json → HTML renderer landed as `src/slopchecker/report/` + `slopcheck render`, tests green / next: PDF step (Alex), wire to models.py when #3 lands / blocked on nothing
- 10:57 Nick — did first real Railway deploy of the #27 stub, hit a
  Nixpacks/hatchling readme-timing build failure, fixed by dropping
  `readme=` from pyproject.toml / live at
  slopchecker-production.up.railway.app, `/health` + `/config` verified /
  next: Wrangler login (needs a browser, can't run headless) + real secret
  values, both mine to do, not the assistant's / blocked on nothing.
- 10:50 Nick — did Railway deploy target (FastAPI health/config stub) +
  Cloudflare Worker scaffold, PR #34 / did rebase onto module-ownership +
  git-discipline CLAUDE.md update / next real secret values go in via
  `railway variables set`, run directly, not through an AI session / blocked
  on nothing.
